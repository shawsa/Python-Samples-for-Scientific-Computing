    "I have observed a tendency in those new to Python to write in a procedural, nested-loop-heavy, index-heavy style reminiscent of C, Fortran, or Matlab. Matlab was heavily influenced by Fortran and both C and Fortran are fairly low-level languages in which this style is often necessary. Python, however, is a high-level scripting language and has preferred alternatives to this style. Indices should be avoided, and can be avoided in most cases. A weaker, but similar statement can be made for loops, and in particular nested loops. In general, you should read and follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#code-lay-out) - the canonical python style guide.\n",

    "Here is a more pythonic example. Note that we again use the `combinations_with_replacement` function to avoid the looping. We also use nested generator expressions. It might be advisable to separate these and name the inner expression `unfiltered_sum_of_cubes` for example. We also use the python `set` data type to ensure we have unique values. Another way to do this (if another data structure is preferred) is to use the keyword `in`, however the set data type uses hash tables and thus has $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ lookup. The set data type also has the advantage of sorting the values for free when the string representation is formed by the `print` function."

# Python-Samples-for-Scientific-Computing

In my time in graduate school I have learned and developed some techniques for writing clear, extensible, and Pythonic code in the domain of scientific computing. The purpose of this repository is to share what I have learned, and hopfully encourage other students and academics to write in a more Pythonic style.

    "I have observed a tendency in my peers to write in a procedural, nested-loop-heavy, index-heavy style reminiscent of C, Fortran, or Matlab. Matlab was heavily influenced by Fortran (citation needed?) and both C and Fortran are fairly low-level languages in which this style is often necessary. Python, however, is a high-level scripting language and has many alternatives to this style. Indices should be avoided, and can be avoided in most cases. A weaker, but similar statement can be made for loops, and in particular nested loops.\n",

    "Often I see people code in the procedural paradigm. Presumably this is because they are primed to approach mathematical algorithms in this way, either by algorithm pseudo code in a textbook, or because they are converting code from another language; or perhaps they are unaware of the alternatives. Functional programming (my preference) and object oriented programming have significant benefits, and ought to be considered when appropriate."
